# Numerical_Analysis

Remember solving quadratic equations in Grade 8, solving for "x" in an equation that we had no idea where it would be used? The whole field of mathematics and its applications is about solving equations or system of equations, not just linear, to get down to numbers to get a sense of the real system we are working with. Unfortunately, it is always not possible to find the exact solutions. But we have few methods that help us get a rough estimate of the solution using elegant iterative methods. In this repo, I add pyrhon code for each of these methods.

## Solution to Non-linear Equation:
1. [Bisection method](https://github.com/ASudu/Numerical_Analysis/blob/main/Bisection.py)
2. [Secant method](https://github.com/ASudu/Numerical_Analysis/blob/main/Secant.py)
3. [Regula-Falsi method](https://github.com/ASudu/Numerical_Analysis/blob/main/Regula-Falsi.py)
4. Newton-Raphson method
5. Fixed point method
   
Rest of the methods will be updated as course progresses
